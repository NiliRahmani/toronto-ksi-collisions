"""Put the repository root on the import path for the test suite.

Without this, `pytest` finds the tests but cannot import `ksi`, because pytest
adds the test file's own directory to sys.path rather than the project root. It
works under `python -m pytest` purely because that form adds the working
directory, which is an easy way to ship a suite that only runs one way.
